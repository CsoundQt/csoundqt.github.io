## Install Csound First!

CsoundQt is a frontend for Csound, so **Csound needs to be installed first.**  
[*-> Csound download page*](https://csound.com/download)


## Mac

1. Download the **CsoundQt-[Version Number]-MacOS.dmg** from <https://github.com/CsoundQt/CsoundQt/releases>.  
   *NOTE: Choose the plain version (without "pythonqt") for normal use.*  
2. Open the *.dmg* and drag the green CsoundQt application into the Applications folder.

## Windows

1. Download the **CsoundQt-[Version Number]-Win64.zip** from <https://github.com/CsoundQt/CsoundQt/releases>.  
2. Unzip the file.  
3. Go to the *CsoundQt (or bin)* folder.  
4. Select and copy the whole content of the *bin* folder.  
5. Go to *C: -> Program Files -> Csound6_x64 -> bin* and paste all the copied files here.  
6. Send "CsoundQt-d-html-cs6.exe" from this folder as a shortcut to your desktop if you like. 

## Linux

CsoundQt binaries are in most of the package managers.

These binaries might be built without *RtMidi* and/or without *PythonQt* support. If you need to work with it, you should **build CsoundQt**. Instructions can be found at <https://github.com/CsoundQt/CsoundQt/wiki> and in the [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/CsoundQt/CsoundQt/blob/master/BUILDING.md) file in the sources.
