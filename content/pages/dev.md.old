Getting the sources
--------

The source files for CsoundQt can be browsed and downloaded from Github:
[https://github.com/CsoundQt/CsoundQt](https://github.com/CsoundQt/CsoundQt)

You can also find source releases in the Files section of [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/qutecsound/files/CsoundQt/).


Building
-----
We try to provide a set of build instructions in [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/CsoundQt/CsoundQt/blob/master/BUILDING.md).

There are also some detailed descriptions about building CsoundQt in
the [CsoundQt Wiki](https://github.com/CsoundQt/CsoundQt/wiki).

Translating
---

Translating CsoundQt is very easy. Just let me know you want to translate into a certain language, and I'll generate the tranlsation file. Then you can translate it with Qt Linguist, which is a very easy to use program, which will assist you in the translation. When you're done, just send the finished translation.
You can get QtLinguist with the Qt SDK, or as an individual program here:
