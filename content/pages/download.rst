CsoundQt is included in the Csound installers for Mac OSX and Windows. So the easiest way to get CsoundQt for OSX and Windows is to download and install `Csound <http://csound.github.io/download.html>`_. For Windows, this will also install CsoundQt automatically. For OSX, you will find a .dmg which contains CsoundQt. Install Csound first, then activate the Disk Image, and drag the CsoundQt icon to the Applications folder.

For Debian / Ubuntu, there is a recent CsoundQt package at `Debian Unstable <https://packages.debian.org/unstable/csoundqt>`_. You can download and install it in the usual way (dpkg -i).

The latest release of the sources and the latest OSX installer are at `https://github.com/CsoundQt/CsoundQt/releases/latest <https://github.com/CsoundQt/CsoundQt/releases/latest>`_.

Other (older) pre-built binaries and nightly builds for OS X can be found on the `Sourceforge Files page <https://sourceforge.net/projects/qutecsound/files/CsoundQt/>`_. The nightly build server is kindly provided by the `Institute for Computer Music and Sound Technology (ICST) <http://www.icst.net/>`_ at ZHDK.

It's also relatively easy to `build CsoundQt <|filename|building.md>`_.
